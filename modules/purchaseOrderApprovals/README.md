# Purchase Order Approvals

ðŸ›‘ **Module on hold.**

A solution to ensure parts orders exceeding certain thresholds
are approved before ordering.

## Getting Started

Install the **Purchase Orders Approval Sidebar** userscript
from [the City's userscript library](https://cityssm.github.io/userscripts/#userscripts-for-faster-web).

Navigate to a parts order in FASTER Web.
The approval sidebar should appear, asking to be configured.

The FASTER Web Helper URL will be something like this.

```text
http://serverNameOrIp:9000/
```

You must log into the Approval sidebar with your Active Directory credentials
to link your FASTER account with your Active Directory account.
Once logged in, your account link will be saved on your computer
until you either log out or a different FASTER Web user logs in.
